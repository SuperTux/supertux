##### Additional debugging information

*If available, please attach a backtrace of a crash (you can get one using GDB or another debugger), or a core dump. If you're on GNU/Linux and your distro is using systemd, it's highly likely that a core dump is available using `coredumpctl(1)`.
If the issue only occurs in a custom level, please attach that too.*

##### Guidelines for reporting issues

- [ ] This report only includes details about **one** (1) issue, feature request or topic.
- [ ] If I make a mistake while submitting this report I will use the edit feature instead of closing this issue and opening a new one.
