Version 0.0.5

December 9, 2003


REQUIREMENTS
------------

  CONTROLS
  --------
    The game can be played with either a the keyboard or a joystick.

  SDL
  ---
    "Super Tux" was programed using the "Simple Direct Media" layer
    libraries by Sam Lantinga.  This means that the game can
    theoretically run under any environment that the SDL libraries support.

    (As of this program's release, this includes: Linux X11/DGA,
    Win32 WinDIB/DirectX, BeOS BWindow, and Solaris X11, as well
    as unofficually supported: Linux SVGAlib, IRIX 6.x X11,
    FreeBSD 3.x X11, and MacOS.)

    The Simple DirectMedia Layer is required to compile this game.

    You can download the SDL libraries from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/

  SDL_image
  ---------
    SDL_image is also required.  (It is used to load the PNG format images
    that come with Super Tux!)

  SDL_mixer
  ---------
    Sound and music are available, but are not required (see below).
    You will need the "SDL_mixer" library compiled and installed if
    you want sound.


INSTALLING UNDER LINUX/UNIX
---------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Note: Read this entire section before you start issuing commands!
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  First make sure SDL, SDL_image and, optionally, SDL_mixer, are
  installed on your system.

  The "Makefile" that comes with "Super Tux" assumes a number
  of defaults about your system.  You can edit their values in
  the "Makefile" itself, or specify their values when you run
  the "make" command (ie, "make VARIABLE=value").

  The things you will wish to edit are:

    SDL_PREFIX=/usr/local

      This defines the base location where the "include/SDL/"
      and "lib/SDL/" directories will be found.  (They contain
      the C header files and compiled object files for SDL,
      respectively.)


    DATA_PREFIX=$(PWD)/data/

      This defines where "Super Tux"'s "data/" directory is
      to be found.  The default assumes that you wish to leave
      it where it is right now ("$(PWD)" expands to become the
      current direcotry.

      This variable is useful if you plan on moving the "data/"
      directory elsewhere, say a globally-accessible
      "/usr/local/games/supertux-data/".

    JOY=YES

      This causes "Super Tux" to be compiled with joystick
      support.  If you don't have a version of SDL that supports
      joystick, or just don't want joystick support, set this to "NO".


  To compile the game, type the command:

    make           [ with whatever variable changes you want, if any ]

  If you decided that you wanted the data somewhere else, make sure
  to move it there.  If you wanted it to be accessible to others
  (ie, you're an administrator installing a new game for your users),
  make sure to set the permissions for the files!  (You'll also want
  to move the "supertux" binary to somewhere globally accessible,
  and set its permissions, as well, of course!)

  Note: If you do not have the SDL_mixer library, or wish to not
  compile sound support into the game, you can compile it like this:

    make nosound   [ with whatever variable changes you want, if any ]

  If you wish to return the directory to its distribution state,
  (remove the ".o" object files, and the "supertux" executable program
  file), you can run:

    make clean


ICON FILE
---------
  A 32x32, XPM-format icon file (using the standard 23-color "cmap.xpm"
  color palette) is available if you wish to use an icon for this game.

  The file is "supertux-icon.xpm", and installed in Super Tux's
  "data/images/" directory.


The End!
