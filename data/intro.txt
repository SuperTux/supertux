-Penny gets captured!

	Tux and Penny were out having a nice
	picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
	Suddenly, a creature jumped from
	behind an ice bush, there was a flash,
	and Tux fell asleep!

	When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny
	is missing. Where she lay before now
	lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!"
	says the letter. "I have captured
	your beautiful Penny and have taken her
	to my fortress. The path to my fortress
	is littered with my minions. Give up on
	the thought of trying to reclaim her,
	you haven't a chance! -Nolok"

	Tux looks and see Nolok's fortress in
	the distance. Determined to save his
	beloved Penny, he begins his journey.
