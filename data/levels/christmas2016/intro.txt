  (text "-Ready for Christmas?

	It was the last day before christmas
	and Tux and Penny had a nice spot
	on a small island next to icy island.

	Almost everything was done
	for the perfect christmas day.
	But there was still one last thing missing.

	They still needed a christmas tree.
	And Tux immediately went on his way 
	to search for a beautiful christmas tree.") )
