  (text "- Congratulations!

  You have passed the main castle of this worldmap.
  However, there yet remains several more difficult
  levels to test your mettle.  Can you pass them, including
  the castle in the forest to the south?  In addition a
  parallel pathway exists on this map, good luck finding it.
