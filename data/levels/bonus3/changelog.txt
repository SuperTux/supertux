Changes made to worldmap by LMH AUG-2013:
*Numerous tweaks to make badguys killable, as well as many playability changes to
some of the lower-quality levels.  Removed some redundant graphics as well as
changed some graphics to those already in SuperTux, this should dramatically
reduce the size of this add-on.  Finally, some localization support is now part
of the add-on.

*Changed 'Mantis Valley' level name 'level strif ehT <--' (The first level
backwards) to 'eman level ehT <--' (The level name backwards) to be less
confusing since the level is neither the first nor is it backwards.
