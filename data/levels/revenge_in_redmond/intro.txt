 Or was it a dream?

	Tux and Gown were having a nice picnic,
	when suddenly, Gown is beamed away!!!
	
	Wait a second... Gown?
	Who is this penguin that looks
	an awful lot like his friend Penny?
	
	Also, a helicopter?
	Since when do helicopters casually fly
	over Antarctica and abduct penguins?
	
	Even though Tux was visibly confused
	about the events that just transpired,
	he could not just stand there
	doing nothing. Therefore, he
	gave chase to rescue this
	poor penguin girl!
