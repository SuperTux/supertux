	Tux ran into the castle's throne room,
	frantically searching for the penguin girl Gown.
	
	Alas, he found neither Gown, nor the pilot
	of the helicopter there, but instead, a statue.
	
	It depicted a scally creature with crossed arms.
	The pedestal it resided on was inscribed
	with the word \"Nolok\". Was it a name?
	
	He was unsure who or what
	this statue was depicting.
	
	All of a sudden, Tux remembered...
	
	He and Penny were ambushed
	by this exact creature,
	during their picnic on the ice fields!
	
	Tux opened his eyes. He was back
	at the ice fields near the shore.
	Penny, however, was gone.
	Shocked by this, he began looking around,
	but all he could find was a note...
	
	...from Nolok.
