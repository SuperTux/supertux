	After a laborious journey through the
	Halloween island Tux can finally spot the
	house in the distance. The lights are on
	and he can hear some music. This time it
	seems to be the correct house.

	Penny is already awaiting him at the door
	and wondering what took him so long. The
	embarrassment about his earlier mistake
	fades and he jumps for joy.

	Time to party!


-The End
 For now...
