DESCRIPTION
-----------
  SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
  Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

  Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
  on them, bumping them from below or tossing objects at them, grabbing
  power-ups and other stuff on the way.


STORY
-----

- Penny gets captured! -

  Tux and Penny were out having a nice
  picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
  Suddenly, a creature jumped from
  behind an ice bush, there was a flash,
  and Tux fell asleep!

  When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny
  is missing. Where she lay before now
  lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!"
  says the letter. "I have captured
  your beautiful Penny and have taken her
  to my fortress. The path to my fortress
  is littered with my minions. Give up on
  the thought of trying to reclaim her,
  you haven't a chance! -Nolok"

  Tux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in
  the distance. Determined to save his
  beloved Penny, he begins his journey.

RUNNING THE GAME
----------------
  SuperTux makes use of proc to see where it is. In other words, it does not
  have any need to be installed and can be run from anywhere. This makes
  it possible to click in the executable in your filemanager (i.e. Konqueror or
  Nautilus) as opposed to many other Linux games.

  Options can be reached from the menu, so you don't need to specify arguments,
  but if you want, type 'supertux2 --help' to check the ones that are available.
  Also, notice that SuperTux saves the options, so it's often enough to
  specify them once. For example, fullscreen mode causes problems on some setups,
  so just run 'supertux2 --window' and you should be set.

  The game uses OpenGL to render the graphics. You will either need a CPU
  with about 10 GHz or an accelerated video card with the vendor's drivers.
  (On Linux, the team recommends using cards from NVidia with the proprietary
  drivers, but ATI or another vendor should do.)


PLAYING THE GAME
----------------
  Controls
  --------
  Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change the
  controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will need to
  use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck, right, left, power
  and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much to tell about the first
  few, but the "action" key allows you to pick up objects and use any powerup
  you got. For instance, with the fire flower, you can shoot bullets (note
  that this is the only power currently implemented).

  Other useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu or
  to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the arrow
  keys or the mouse.

  In the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to enter
  the current level.
