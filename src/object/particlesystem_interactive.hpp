/**
   This is an alternative class for particle systems. It is
   responsible for storing a set of particles with each having an x-
   and y-coordinate the number of the layer where it should be drawn
   and a texture.

   This version of the particle system class doesn't use virtual
   screen coordinates, but Interactive ones. Particle systems which
   need Interactive levels coordinates, such as rain, should be
   implemented here.

   Classes that implement a particle system should subclass from this
   class, initialize particles in the constructor and move them in the
   simulate function.
