//
// An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
// rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
// interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
// bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is
// then initialized to contain information for random number generation with
// that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state
// information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by
// calling the setstate() routine with the same array as was initialized
// with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state
// information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
// congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
// 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.
//
// Internally, the state information is treated as an array of longs; the
// zeroeth element of the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small
// integer); the remainder of the array is the state information for the
// R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of state information will give 7 longs worth of
// state information, which will allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note:
// the zeroeth word of state information also has some other information
// stored in it -- see setstate() for details).
//
// The random number generation technique is a linear feedback shift register
// approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms to sum up that
// way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all the numbers in
// the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register, and will
// have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial being
// used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).  The
// higher order bits will have longer periods, since their values are also
// influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The total
// period of the generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus doubling
// the amount of state information has a vast influence on the period of the
// generator.  Note: the deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation only good for
// large deg, when the period of the shift is the dominant factor.
// With deg equal to seven, the period is actually much longer than the
// 7*(2**7 - 1) predicted by this formula.
//
// Modified 28 December 1994 by Jacob S. Rosenberg.
//

//
// For each of the currently supported random number generators, we have a
// break value on the amount of state information (you need at least this
// many bytes of state info to support this random number generator), a degree
// for the polynomial (actually a trinomial) that the R.N.G. is based on, and
// the separation between the two lower order coefficients of the trinomial.
