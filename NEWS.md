SuperTux 0.6.0 (2018-12-23)

The SuperTux team is excited to announce the availability of the first alpha for the upcoming stable release 0.6.0 after almost two years of development.

Changes:
* Complete redesign of the icy world and forest world

    * Improved big Tux graphics (Thanks to Alzter)

* Official Linux binaries

**Note:** If you've previously used torches in your levels and their positioning is off, please re-position them. We had to re-align their bounding boxes in order to fix bugs with their flame.

---------------------------

This is a bugfix release fixing some smaller problems that were reported after
the release of 0.5.0. It mostly features changes to the behavior of the level
editor, and adds some options that were missing but should have been included in
the stable release 0.5.0.

  add objects to a nice location in levels)

  relative to the window/screen size

SuperTux 0.3.5a (2015-05-01)
----------------------------

A bugfix release is sneaking in. 3 weeks after 0.3.5 was released it's time to
fix some bugs. This affects mostly the windows installer where some libraries
were missing and add-ons couldn't be downloaded. Luckily we managed to get all
of these nasty bugs away.
One more patch affects linux packagers: The AppData file from our repository is
now contained in the source package.
Thanks to the activity of some translators there are also new translations in
this release.

SuperTux 0.3.4 (2013-07)
------------------------

It's been more than three years since the last development snapshot for
Milestone 2 of SuperTux, making this a bit overdue. Once again it is hard to
say what the most notable changes are, but one thing players should notice is
a greater wealth of levels to play through an expanded avalibility of add-ons.

Additionally, SuperTux development has moved to GitHub. Check it out at:
https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/

If you are intersted in contribuiting to SuperTux, please do so. The more
people working on the project, the faster development can continue. The hope
is that this release will generate more interest which will lead to more
frequent releases. You can refer to the GitHub wiki page on "Contributing" to get
started.

And of course, enjoy the game and have fun!


SuperTux 0.3.3 (2010-02-26)
---------------------------

After more than three years of development the SuperTux development team has
agreed to package a development snapshot of Milestone 2 of our jump and run
game.

Unfortunatly, after such a long time it's hard to say what the most notable
changes are. We hope that the game engine is more stable (or at least more
advanced ;) and that the game is more fun to play overall.


We hope you enjoy SuperTux. Now off you go, rescue Penny! ;)


SuperTux 0.3.2-SVN (2007-12-20)
-------------------------------

Just in time for Christmas, we bring you SuperTux 0.3.2-SVN, a preview
of SuperTux Milestone 2.

This build doesn't contain all levels planned for Milestone 2 and
its story is by no means complete, but the game is already fun to
play.

SuperTux 0.3.2-SVN features:

* new, OpenGL- and OpenAL-based engine
* final boss for Icy Island
* brand new Forest World with new badguys and new game objects
* new and improved soundtrack, immersive sound effects
* much more...

The changes in more detail: The SuperTux 0.1 engine was nearly
completely rewritten. The game is translatable now, a new camera
algorithm allows scrolling in all four directions. Collision
detection supports slopes and moving objects now. We have scripting
support for dynamic level events and animations. New game objects
include trampolines, switches, portable stones, upside-down
levels, wind, moving platforms and particle effects. The sound
system is now OpenAL-based with an improved soundtrack now played
from Ogg/Vorbis-files, which were pre-rendered on a high-class
synthesizer.

This is also a call for artists and coders: If you like the game in
its current state, join us and help us finish Milestone 2!
