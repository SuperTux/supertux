# This monstrosity essentially adds a complex package wrapping
# function, but it's honestly impressive. It essentially tries to
# default to find_package, however, this may not always work,
# especially on *NIX machines or anything weird like that. So, being
# clever, it then tries to go to PkgConfig, which (generally speaking)
# tends to produce more accurate results on *NIX machines.

# Usage:
#
#   add_package(TARGET SDL2       <-- The output target, a "target alias" (sometimes).
#      PKG SDL2                   <-- The find_package package, in this case it gets SDL2
#                                     (might look similar to the output target).
#      PKG_USE SDL2::SDL2         <-- Specific target from the package we want to alias.
#      CONFIG                     <-- (optional) Passed to find_package if its a CONFIG.
#      REQUIRED                   <-- (optional) NOT passed to find_package, just a check to
#                                     throw an error if we've exhausted all options.
#      PKG_CONFIG sdl2 sdl2_ttf   <-- (optional, recommended) List of packages for pkg-config.
#      PREFER_PKGCONFIG           <-- (optional) If the host machine is running a unix-like,
#   )                                 skip the find_package call and use pkg-config.

# NOTE: The PREFER_PKGCONFIG option gets ignored if ${PKG}_PREFER_FIND_PACKAGE is true.
