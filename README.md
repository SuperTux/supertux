# SuperTux - <http://supertuxproject.org/>

Last update: December 20, 2015

## Description

SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
on them, bumping them from below or tossing objects at them, grabbing
power-ups and other stuff on the way.


## Story: Penny gets captured!

Tux and Penny were out having a nice picnic on the ice fields of
Antarctica. Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there
was a flash, and Tux fell asleep!

When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay
before now lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!" says the letter. "I
have captured your beautiful Penny and have taken her to my fortress.
The path to my fortress is littered with my minions. Give up on the
thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven't got a chance! -Nolok"

Tux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to
save his beloved Penny, he begins his journey.


## Documentation

Important documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.
Please see them:

* `INSTALL.md` - Requirements, compiling and installing.
* `README.md` - This file
* `NEWS.md` - Changes since the previous versions of SuperTux.
* `LICENSE.txt` - The GNU General Public License, under whose terms SuperTux is
licensed. (Most of the data subdirectory is also licensed under
CC-by-SA)
* `docs/levelguidelines.txt` - Very useful information for those that want to
design levels for SuperTux.
* `data/credits.txt` - Credits for people that contributed to the creation of
SuperTux. (You can view these in the game menu as well.)


## Running the game

SuperTux makes use of proc to see where it is. In other words, it does
not have any need to be installed and can be run from anywhere. This
makes it possible to click in the executable in your filemanager (i.e.
Konqueror or Nautilus) as opposed to many other Linux games.

Options can be reached from the menu, so you don't need to specify
arguments, but if you want, type `supertux2 --help` to check the ones
that are available. Also, notice that SuperTux saves the options, so
it's often enough to specify them once. For example, fullscreen mode
causes problems on some setups, so just run `supertux2 --window` and
you should be set.

The game uses OpenGL to render the graphics. You will either need a
CPU with about 1 GHz or an accelerated video card with recent
graphics drivers.


## Playing the game

Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change
the controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will
need to use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck,
right, left, action and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much
to tell about the first few, but the "action" key allows you to pick
up objects and use any powerup you got. For instance, with the fire
flower, you can shoot fireballs, or with the ice flower fire ice pellets.

Other useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu
or to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the
arrow keys or the mouse.

In the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to
enter the current level.


## Development status

With the release of SuperTux Milestone 2 (December 2015), we hope to
provide a fairly stable release. Development of the game will continue
(of course), now working towards a Milestone 3 release.

The Forest World (you can check it out:
Start Game > Contrib Levels > Forest World) is notably unstable, which
is why it resides only in the contrib levels menu. We (SuperTux Team)
intend to continue with the development of the Forest World, but
decided that in order to allow more access to the most recent version
(in repositories etc.) we would have to release Milestone 2 without the 
Forest World included in the Story Mode.

Don't forget that you can get involved with the development at

## The End

Thanks for playing SuperTux.
