Last update: February 26, 2010

##Description
  SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
  Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

  Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
  on them, bumping them from below or tossing objects at them, grabbing
  power-ups and other stuff on the way.


##Story

####Penny gets captured!

Tux and Penny were out having a nice picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.
Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there was a flash, and
Tux fell asleep!
When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay before now
lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!" says the letter. "I have captured your
beautiful Penny and have taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress
is littered with my minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim
her, you haven't a chance! -Nolok"
Tux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to save his
beloved Penny, he begins his journey.


##Documentation
Important documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.
Please see them:

File Name     | Content

`INSTALL.md`     | Requirements, compiling and installing.
`README.md`   | This file
`WHATSNEW.txt` | Changes since the previous versions of SuperTux.
`COPYING`     | The GNU General Public License, under whose terms SuperTux is licensed. (Most of the data subdirectory is also licensed under CC-by-SA)
`docs/levelguidelines.txt` | Very useful information for those that want to design levels for SuperTux.
`data/credits.txt` | Credits for people that contributed to the creationof SuperTux. (You can view these in the game menuas well.)
`data/README` | Licensing information about the data.



##Running the game
  SuperTux makes use of proc to see where it is. In other words, it does not
  have any need to be installed and can be run from anywhere. This makes
  it possible to click in the executable in your filemanager (i.e. Konqueror or
  Nautilus) as opposed to many other Linux games.

  Options can be reached from the menu, so you don't need to specify arguments,
  but if you want, type 'supertux2 --help' to check the ones that are available.
  Also, notice that SuperTux saves the options, so it's often enough to
  specify them once. For example, fullscreen mode causes problems on some setups,
  so just run 'supertux2 --window' and you should be set.

  The game uses OpenGL to render the graphics. You will either need a CPU
  with about 10 GHz or an accelerated video card with the vendor's drivers.
  (On Linux, the team recommends using cards from NVidia with the proprietary
  drivers, but ATI or another vendor should do.)


##Playing the game
###Controls
  Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change the
  controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will need to
  use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck, right, left, power
  and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much to tell about the first
  few, but the "action" key allows you to pick up objects and use any powerup
  you got. For instance, with the fire flower, you can shoot bullets (note
  that this is the only power currently implemented).

  Other useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu or
  to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the arrow
  keys or the mouse.

  In the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to enter
  the current level.


##Development status
  This version of SuperTux is still under development, even though the
  0.3 line of versions is somewhat aged. This means that badguys, features,
  levels, graphics or anything else may be removed in the future.

  Especially the Forest world included in this package may be subject to
  drastic changes. These changes may go as far as removing the world
  altogether. Currently (February 2010) there is no consensus within the
  SuperTux development community regarding the fate of the Forest. Don't get
  too attached to it ;)
