BINARIES
--------
    
  We try to provide precompiled binaries of supertux for a number of platforms.
  You should check

    http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation
    
  for the packages and instructions on how to install them. If there are no
  prebuilt binaries for your platform, then you might still be able to compile
  the sourcecode yourself. In this case read the next sections.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

  To build supertux from source, you need to have a number of tools and
  libraries installed. Note that most of these things should already be
  available prepackaged and optimized for your distribution, it is recommended
  that you check your distribution first before downloading from the websites.

* Linux development tools (your distribution should come with these):
    - gcc compiler version 3.2 or newer (you need the c++ compiler g++)
        http://gcc.gnu.org
    - gnu binutils
        http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils
    - a shell and posix commandline tools

* perforce jam 2.5 or later
    Download: ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam
    Homepage: http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html

* OpenGL headers and libraries
    opengl libraries and headers are specific to your graphics card. Make sure
    that you have hardware accelerated opengl drivers installed. Software
    renderers like Mesa will make supertux unplayable slow.

* SDL 1.2.5 or later (1.2.8 is recommended on MacOS/X)
    http://www.libsdl.org

* SDL_image (any version)
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image

* PhysicsFS (1.0.0, the development branch 1.1.x is buggy and does not work,
             1.2.0 and later should work when it is released)
    http://www.icculus.org/physfs

* OpenAL
    There are no official linux releases of OpenAL yet, you should grab the
    latest cvs snapshot (any snapshot from 2005 should work, earlier snapshots
    tend to have bugs). OpenAL 1.0 or later implementations on other systems
    like MacOS/X or windows should work.
    
    http://www.openal.org

  Note: We tried to write our code clean, portable and platform neutral, so it
  should be possible to compile it on a wide range of platforms and also with
  other compilers than gcc. However we have no resources to test other setups
  and it is likely that you hit small problems. Reports and binary compiled
  packages are of course always welcome. Send them to
  supertux-devel@lists.berlios.de

INSTALLING UNDER LINUX/UNIX
---------------------------

  Supertux uses a normal autoconf configure script. The simplest way to compile
  this package is:

    1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
       `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
       using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
       `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
       `configure' itself.

       Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
       messages telling which features it is checking for.

    2. Type `jam' to compile the package.

    3. Type `jam install' to install the programs and any data files and
       documentation. (You should be root user on linux systems.
       You can become root user with the `su' command or by using
       `sudo jam install')

    4. The game should work now and you can remove the source directory

  You can customize the build process by specifying additional parameters for
  the configure script. Type `./configure --help' for additional informations.
  Some common options are:

    --prefix=$HOME/.local
        Installs supertux in your HOME directory in the .local folder.
        This avoids the need for system administrator privileges when
        installing the game
    --with-XXX=Prefix
        Manually specify the installation directory of a library
    --enable-debug
        Enables debug mode and compiles extra debug symbols into the supertux
        executable. This is usefull when sending in bug reports to the
        developers.

Note for SVN users:
  SuperTux does not need to be installed on the system, you can run it from
  its own directory.
  
  If no configure script exists (e.g. in case you've retrieved SuperTux
  from SVN), just run the autogen.sh script. You'll need autoconf
  for this.


ICON FILE
---------

  A 32x32, XPM-format icon file is available if you wish to use
  an icon for a menu entry for this game.

  The file is "supertux.xpm", and can be found in the
  data/images/engine/icons/ directory.

SUPPORT
-------

  You can contact us at supertux-devel@lists.berlios.de and in the #supertux
  channel on the irc.freenode.net irc server.
